# Information-Retrieval-HW

This repository contains one homework for the advanced Information Retrieval Course.(Semester: Spring 2021-2022) In this assignment, I gathered different president's speech text and processed those texts. The assignment consists of different steps:
* **Gathering Data**: Data for the speech of three different presidents waas gathered using [this website](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/app-categories/presidential/letters).Data is available in the `data.json` file.
* **Tokenization**: After gathering data, pure text was tokenized.
* **Normalization**: Tokenized text was normalized in order to be easier to process it in the next step.
* **Comparing the Frequency of Tokens before and After Normalization**
* **Lemmatization**
* **POS-Tagging**: This part was done using `nltk` tagger as well as `brown` tagger.
